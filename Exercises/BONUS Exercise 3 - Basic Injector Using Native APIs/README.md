# Bonus Exercise 3 - Basic Injector Using Native APIs

## Description

Modify your injector from [Exercise 2](../Exercise%202%20-%20Basic%20Shellcode%20Injector/) such that it injects the shellcode using Native APIs only.

## Tips

We discussed native APIs (from `ntdll`) as part of the workshop, [Exercise 1](../Exercise%201%20-%20Basic%20Shellcode%20Loader/), and [Bonus Exercise 1](../BONUS%20Exercise%201%20-%20Basic%20Loader%20Without%20CreateThread/). If you looked into the Native API as part of these exercises, this bonus exercise should be a breeze!
